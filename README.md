# Flex Detector ðŸ’ª

Welcome to the **Flex Detector**! This project is a web tool designed to analyze social media captions or posts and determine if they're "flexing" (showing off). It's a fun, interactive way to engage with social media content and see if a post is humble or if it leans towards a display of extravagance.
